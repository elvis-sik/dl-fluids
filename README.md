This is the code for my (in the works) bachelor thesis.
    
    $ python solve_cases.py
    
Will solve a series of low-Reynolds flow around polygon cases using OpenFOAM.

The code in `train.py` is then used in `Analysis.ipynb` to train a neural network
to predict the velocity and pressure fields as well as the drag coefficient.
